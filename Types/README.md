* Implicit Types
    When TypeScript infers the type of a variable based on the assigned value without you explicitly declaring the type, it is known as implicit typing. This can make your code more concise.
* Explicit Types
    When you explicitly declare the type of a variable, it is known as explicit typing. This can make your code more readable and helps prevent errors by making your intentions clear.
